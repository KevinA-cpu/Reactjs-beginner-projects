The following projects are the results of my learning of Reactjs, all credits go to the course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8

I guaranteed that these projects are not copy and paste, I had fully commited and following closely to the teachings of the maker of the course. I did not think up of these projects myself but thanks to the guidance of him that I was able to learn alot and build functional web pages.

I will show demo pictures of the webs below:

1. Static React Information page
